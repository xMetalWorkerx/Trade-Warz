# Templates

This directory contains templates for consistent documentation and design work on Trade Warz.

## Available Templates

### Design Templates
- **`card_template.md`** - For designing new cards (exports, tactics, policies)
- **`leader_template.md`** - For designing new leaders or documenting existing ones
- **`playtest_template.md`** - For recording playtesting sessions

### Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the template** to the appropriate directory
2. **Rename the file** to match your content (e.g., `freedom_corn_export.md`)
3. **Fill in all sections** - don't leave blanks
4. **Update status checkboxes** as you progress
5. **Include version information** and update dates

### Template Guidelines

- **Be thorough** - fill in all sections even if some seem obvious
- **Be specific** - provide concrete details rather than vague descriptions
- **Update regularly** - keep information current as the design evolves
- **Cross-reference** - link to related documents when helpful
- **Version control** - track changes and iterations

### Customization

Feel free to modify these templates as the project evolves. If you create new templates, add them to this README and consider if they should become standard for the project.
