# Trade Warz - Frequently Asked Questions

## Core Mechanics

### Q: How long do trade routes last?
**A: Trade routes are permanent once established.** They remain active for the entire game unless explicitly destroyed by card effects. Routes never "expire" or "end" naturally.

### Q: Does influence ever decrease?
**A: No, influence never decreases naturally.** It only decreases when explicitly reduced by card effects. Influence accumulates throughout the game, creating territorial control.

### Q: What's the difference between GDP and influence?
**A: GDP is currency that gets spent on bids, costs, and tracking victory. Influence accumulates permanently and provides dispute advantages and suzerainty benefits.**

### Q: How does the CMYK system work?
**A: The CMYK system determines the order effects resolve during Upkeep:**
- **C (Canary/Global)**: Effects that affect all players
- **M (Mint/Personal)**: Effects that affect only you
- **Y (Yeti/Opponent)**: Effects that target opponents
- **K (Kraken/Trading)**: Effects related to Trading Partners

## Gameplay

### Q: Can I move a route once it's placed?
**A: No, once placed, routes cannot be moved or rearranged.** The 3-minute timer creates pressure to make good placement decisions.

### Q: What happens if I can't pay a GDP cost?
**A: You cannot play the card or take the action.** GDP is required upfront for all costs. Plan your economy carefully.

### Q: How do disputes work?
**A: Disputes resolve in reverse-GDP order (poorest player first). Each player bids GDP secretly, and the highest total (Influence + GDP bid) wins.**

### Q: Can I play multiple policies per round?
**A: No, you can only play ONE policy per round during the Policy phase.** Policies replace any previous policy you had active.

### Q: When can I play tactics?
**A: Tactics can be played ANY TIME before the Trade Phase ends.** They resolve immediately and cannot be responded to (except by other tactics).

## Strategy

### Q: Should I focus on establishing routes early?
**A: Yes! Early route establishment creates compounding returns.** Routes generate income every round, so the earlier you establish them, the more profit you make.

### Q: How important is influence?
**A: Very important! Influence provides dispute advantages and suzerainty benefits.** High influence makes it harder for opponents to take your routes and provides economic bonuses.

### Q: When should I destroy opponent routes?
**A: Route destruction is expensive (4-6 GDP) but can swing games.** Target high-value routes when opponents are vulnerable, or when you need to prevent them from winning.

### Q: How do I catch up if I'm behind?
**A: The game has built-in catch-up mechanics:**
- Poorest player resolves disputes first
- Many policies favor trailing players
- Route destruction can swing games
- Events often help underdogs

## Card Effects

### Q: What does "destroy" mean?
**A: "Destroy" means the route is permanently removed from the game.** The owner loses all future income and influence from that route.

### Q: Can I protect my routes from destruction?
**A: Yes, some cards provide temporary protection.** Look for effects like "Your routes cannot be destroyed this round."

### Q: How do "this round" effects work?
**A: "This round" effects last only for the current round.** They don't persist to future rounds unless specifically stated.

### Q: What's the difference between "lose" and "reduce"?
**A: "Lose" typically refers to GDP (currency). "Reduce" typically refers to influence (permanent value).** Be careful with the wording.

## Edge Cases

### Q: What happens if two players tie in a dispute?
**A: Ties are broken by the poorest player.** If the poorest player is involved in the tie, they win.

### Q: Can I have multiple routes to the same Trading Partner?
**A: No, each Trading Partner slot holds only ONE route.** You must dispute with other players to claim contested slots.

### Q: What happens if I run out of cards?
**A: If your Leader deck is empty, you cannot draw from it.** You can still draw from global decks during the Draw phase.

### Q: Can I bank GDP between rounds?
**A: No, GDP is spent immediately.** Some cards may allow banking, but the default is immediate spending.

## Component Questions

### Q: What do I use for GDP tokens?
**A: Pennies and nickels work great!** You can also use dice, cubes, or any small tokens. The game is designed to be accessible.

### Q: How do I track influence?
**A: Use colored cubes or tokens on the Trading Partner cards.** Each player should have a distinct color for easy tracking.

### Q: Do I need a timer?
**A: Yes, a 3-minute timer is essential for the Trade Phase.** Use a phone app, sand timer, or any countdown device.

### Q: How many players can play?
**A: The game supports 2-6 players, with 4 being optimal.** Each player count creates different strategic dynamics.

## Design Philosophy

### Q: Why are routes permanent?
**A: Route permanence creates a persistent economic engine that rewards early investment and creates strategic depth.** It makes every route placement decision meaningful.

### Q: Why does influence accumulate?
**A: Influence accumulation creates territorial control and scaling benefits.** It rewards players for focusing on specific Trading Partners and creates competition for suzerainty.

### Q: Why is there a 3-minute timer?
**A: The timer creates pressure and excitement during the Trade Phase.** It prevents analysis paralysis and keeps the game moving at a good pace.

### Q: Why are there catch-up mechanics?
**A: Catch-up mechanics prevent runaway leaders and keep all players engaged.** They ensure that trailing players always have a chance to recover.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The game feels too long/short
**A: Adjust the number of rounds or the GDP victory condition.** The game is designed to be 45-60 minutes with 5 rounds.

### Q: One leader feels overpowered
**A: This is a balance issue that needs playtesting.** Track win rates by leader and adjust abilities or starting resources.

### Q: Players are confused about rules
**A: Emphasize the permanence rules during setup.** Consider creating a quick reference card for common questions.

### Q: The timer is too stressful
**A: Try "Chill Mode" - remove the timer and have players take turns placing routes clockwise.**

**A: Check the main rules document (`trade_warz_rules_updated.md`) and the design documents in the `design_docs/` folder.**

### Q: How do I report issues?
**A: Document the issue with specific examples and suggest improvements.** Include player feedback and game state information.

### Q: Can I suggest new cards or leaders?
**A: Absolutely! Follow the established patterns and consider balance implications.** Use the card templates in the `templates/` folder.

### Q: How do I contribute to the project?
**A: Playtest the game, provide feedback, suggest improvements, and help with documentation.** This is a collaborative design project.
