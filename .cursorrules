# Trade Warz - Board Game Design Project

## Project Overview
Trade Warz is a satirical board game about economic brinkmanship and meme-driven trade wars. This is a game design project, not traditional software development, but benefits from structured documentation, version control, and AI assistance.

## Game Context
- **Players**: 2-6 (optimal 4)
- **Duration**: 45-60 minutes
- **Theme**: Satirical geopolitics with meme energy
- **Win Condition**: 50 GDP or highest after 5 rounds
- **Core Mechanic**: 3-minute timed trade phase with blind GDP bidding

## Key Design Principles
1. **Quick to teach, quick to finish** - Simple rules, fast gameplay
2. **Big swings without feel-bads** - Catch-up mechanics prevent runaway leaders
3. **Replay through asymmetry** - Each leader has unique abilities and decks
4. **Physical fun** - Tactile components, blind bidding, timer mechanics

## File Structure & Conventions
- `README.md` - Main project overview and status
- `mechanics_prototype.md` - Core game rules and mechanics
- `leader_card.md` - Leader board design specifications
- `art_styles.md` - Visual design exploration
- `todo.md` - Development priorities and resolved issues
- `agents.md` - Guidelines for AI assistants
- `images/` - Art assets and reference materials

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### When Working on This Project:
1. **Understand the context**: This is board game design, not software development
2. **Maintain game balance**: Always consider how changes affect gameplay balance
3. **Preserve the satirical tone**: Keep the humor and meme energy intact
4. **Consider playtesting**: Suggest how changes might affect the player experience
5. **Document decisions**: Explain reasoning behind design choices

### Common Tasks:
- **Mechanics refinement**: Help balance gameplay elements
- **Card design**: Create new cards following established patterns
- **Documentation**: Improve clarity of rules and explanations
- **Art direction**: Provide feedback on visual design choices
- **Playtesting analysis**: Help interpret feedback and suggest improvements

### File Naming Conventions:
- Use descriptive names for new files
- Group related content (e.g., `leader_usa.md`, `leader_china.md`)
- Keep markdown files for documentation
- Use clear, searchable filenames

### Code vs Game Design:
- No traditional "code" - focus on game mechanics, rules, and documentation
- Use markdown for all documentation
- Consider creating templates for consistent card/component design
- Think in terms of game balance, player experience, and thematic consistency

## Current Development Status
- **Phase**: Active prototype development
- **Priority**: Extensive playtesting required for balance
- **Focus**: Leader ability design and testing
- **Next**: Art style finalization and component production planning

## Important Notes
- All mechanics are in prototype stage and subject to change
- Balance testing is critical - avoid "Skullclamp scenarios"
- Blind leader selection recommended during testing
- Win rate tracking helps identify overpowered elements
