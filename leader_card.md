# Leader Board Design

## Physical Layout

### Leader Board (Player Board)
**Size**: 8" × 6" portrait orientation (6" wide × 8" tall)

Each leader board stays in front of the player and displays:

**Header Section**:
- **Leader Name**: Large, bold header
- **Theme/Tagline**: Thematic description
- **Portrait Placeholder**: 2" × 2" box for leader artwork

**Stats Section**:
- **Starting GDP**: Initial GDP value
- **Hand Size**: Maximum cards in hand
- **Trade Route Slots**: Number of trade route tracker slots (5)

**Abilities Section**:
- **Unique Abilities**: 2-3 leader-specific abilities with clear descriptions
- Each ability includes name and effect text

**Trade Route Tracker**:
- **5 numbered slots** arranged horizontally
- Used to track which of the player's trade routes are currently active
- Helps players visualize their economic engine at a glance
- Uniform across all leaders (all have 5 slots)

**CMYK Reminder**:
- Quick reference strip showing upkeep order: C → M → Y → K

**Note**: Export cards are NOT placed on leader boards. They are placed adjacent to Trading Partner boards. The trade route tracker is just a visual aid to help players remember which routes they have active.

## Trade Route Mechanics

### How Routes Work
When a player establishes a trade route:
1. **Export card** is placed adjacent to the Trading Partner board in one of the route slots
2. **Trade Route Tracker** on the leader board can be marked (optional) to show active routes
3. Routes persist until explicitly destroyed by card effects
4. Each route generates GDP during the Income phase

### Trade Route Tracker vs Route Slots
**Important Distinction**:
- **Trading Partner Route Slots**: Physical slots on trading partner boards where Export cards are placed
  - Large markets: 5 slots
  - Medium markets: 4 slots
  - Small markets: 3 slots
  - Limited resource - competition for these slots drives gameplay

- **Leader Board Trade Route Tracker**: Visual aid on leader board (5 slots)
  - NOT where Export cards go
  - Used to track which routes you have active
  - Helps players remember their economic engine
  - Can use tokens/coins to mark active routes

## Design Decisions

### Trade Route Tracker: Uniform (5 slots)
**Decision**: All leaders have 5 tracker slots on their board

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies production (one board template)
- Easier for playtesting and iteration
- Leader asymmetry comes from abilities, not slot count
- 5 slots provides room for growth and flexibility
- Players are not limited to 5 routes - can mark overflow differently

### No Physical Card Slots on Leader Boards
**Decision**: Leader boards don't have physical slots for Export/Policy cards

**Rationale**:
- Export cards go adjacent to Trading Partner boards (where the route actually is)
- Policy cards stay in hand or separate play area
- Keeps leader board focused on information display
- Simpler board design and production
- More flexible for different play styles

### Leader-Specific Theming
- **USA**: Blue/red/white color scheme, economic focus
- **China**: Red/gold scheme, manufacturing emphasis  
- **Russia**: Red/blue/white scheme, energy dominance
- Color coding helps quick identification during play

## Leader Countries/Regions
The three playable leaders in the prototype represent major economic powers:

1. **USA** - Economic Powerhouse
   - Starting GDP: 8
   - Hand Size: 8 cards
   - Trade Route Tracker: 5 slots
   - Abilities: +1 GDP per route, +1 Influence in route disputes

2. **China** - Manufacturing Advantage
   - Starting GDP: 7
   - Hand Size: 7 cards
   - Trade Route Tracker: 5 slots
   - Abilities: +1 Influence in all disputes, Cost reduction abilities

3. **Russia** - Energy Dominance
   - Starting GDP: 6
   - Hand Size: 6 cards
   - Trade Route Tracker: 5 slots
   - Abilities: +2 GDP when destroying routes, +1 GDP per energy export

*Additional leaders (EU, Saudi Arabia, Brazil) planned for future expansion.*

### Printed Components
- **3 Leader Boards**: USA, China, Russia (8" × 6" portrait)
- **Printed on**: 2 sheets (2-up layout on US Letter)
- **Generated by**: `prototype/decks/board-printer/`
- **Print Time**: < 10 seconds to generate PDFs

*See `prototype/leader_specs.md` for complete leader specifications and abilities.*

## Visual Design Notes
- 8" × 6" portrait format provides ample space for information
- Clear hierarchy: Name → Stats → Abilities → Tracker
- Leader-specific color themes for quick identification
- 2" × 2" portrait placeholder ready for artwork
- CMYK reminder strip helps with upkeep phase
- Professional appearance suitable for playtesting

## Production Notes

### Board Printer System
Located in `prototype/decks/board-printer/`, the automated system generates print-ready PDFs:

**Usage**:
```bash
cd prototype/decks/board-printer
npm run convert        # Update from leader_specs.md
npm run build:leaders  # Generate leader board PDFs
```

**Output**: `dist/leaders/fronts.pdf` (2 sheets, 3 boards + 1 empty slot)

### Printing Tips
1. Print on 80-110lb cardstock (matte finish)
2. Use 100% scale (no "fit to page")
3. Cut along outer bleed guides (red dashed lines)
4. Each board should measure 6" wide × 8" tall
5. Preview in browser first: `dist/leaders/preview.html`

## Implementation Notes
- ✅ Leader boards updated to 8" × 6" portrait format
- ✅ Trade route tracker implemented (5 slots, uniform)
- ✅ Leader-specific color themes implemented
- ✅ Automated printing system complete
- ✅ Suzerainty mechanics defined in trading partner system
- ✅ Complete leader specifications in prototype/leader_specs.md
- ✅ Ready for physical prototype playtesting
