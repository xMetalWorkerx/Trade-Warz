# Leader Board Design

## Physical Layout

### Leader Board (Large Format)
Each leader gets a substantial board (larger than a standard card) with:

**Top Section: Export Slots**
- **4-6 numbered export slots** arranged horizontally along the top
- Export cards slide into these slots when trade routes are established
- Numbers correspond to trade route cards

**Bottom Section: Policy Slots** 
- **3-4 policy slots** arranged horizontally along the bottom
- Policy cards slide into these slots when played
- Cards stick out slightly under the board for easy identification and space efficiency

## Trade Route Mechanics

### Trade Route Cards
Each leader receives:
- **One trade route card per possible export slot** (4-6 cards)
- **One extra trade route card** (for flexibility/backup)
- Total: 5-7 trade route cards per leader

### Establishing Trade Routes
When a player wins a trade dispute or places an export unopposed:
1. **Export card** goes into numbered slot on player's leader board
2. **Corresponding trade route card** (matching the slot number) goes onto the Trading Partner's import slot
3. This creates a visual connection between the player's export and its destination

## Design Decisions

### Export Slot Count: Asymmetric (+/-1)
- Leaders will have **4, 5, or 6 export slots** for variety
- Small asymmetry creates leader personality without major balance issues
- Affects economic capacity and strategic focus

### Trade Route Card Mechanics
- **Extra trade route card** used for:
  - **Suzerainty bonuses** from trading partners
  - **Bomb policy effects** that grant additional capacity (uncommon and/or rare)
- Trade route cards are **purely visual markers** - no GDP value or effects
- Cards can be reused when exports are removed/destroyed

### Policy Slot Usage
- **Policies are replaceable** - players can overwrite previous policies
- **Policies can be destroyed** by Tactics or Events
- Creates dynamic tactical layer with policy management

## Leader Countries/Regions
The six playable leaders represent major economic powers:

1. **USA** 
2. **China**
3. **Russia** 
4. **EU** (European Union) - *pronounced "the eww"*
5. **Saudi Arabia**
6. **Brazil**

*Leader names, abilities, and asymmetric slot counts to be developed later.*

## Visual Design Notes
- Cards protruding under the board minimizes board space while maintaining clear organization
- Numbered slots create clear correspondence between export placement and trade route cards
- Large format allows for leader-specific artwork and information

## Implementation Notes
- Update mechanics_prototype.md to reflect 4-6 export slots (currently lists 3-5)
- Suzerainty mechanics will need to be defined for extra trade route card usage
- Policy destruction mechanics need to be integrated into Tactic and Event design
