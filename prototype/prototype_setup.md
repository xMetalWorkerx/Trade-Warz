## Simplified Rules for Prototype

### Trade Phase
1. **Placement**: Players place export cards face-down on trading partner slots
2. **Timer**: 3-minute countdown starts when first export is placed
3. **Disputes**: Resolve contested slots in reverse-GDP order (poorest first)
4. **Resolution**: Printed Influence + blind GDP bid wins

### GDP Economy
- **Trade Routes**: 60-70% of income (Export Value + Trading Partner Bonus)
- **Policies**: 20-25% of income (ongoing effects)
- **Tactics**: 10-15% of income (instant effects)

### Win Conditions
- **Instant Win**: Reach 50 GDP immediately
- **Timed Win**: Highest GDP after 5 rounds
- **Tiebreaker**: Most trading partners influenced

## Prototype Testing Focus

### Key Questions to Answer
1. **Is the 3-minute timer fun or stressful?**
2. **Do the card effects create interesting decisions?**
3. **Is the GDP economy balanced?**
4. **Are the trading partner abilities too powerful?**
5. **Does the game feel too short/long?**

### Balance Issues to Watch
- **Pipeline Monopoly**: Is the destruction bonus too strong?
- **Currency Manipulation**: Does the GDP swap break close games?
- **Oil Shock**: What counts as "Energy-related" exports?
- **Meme War**: Is stealing random cards too random?

### Feedback to Collect
- **Fun factor**: Which cards created the most excitement?
- **Confusion**: Which rules were unclear?
- **Balance**: Which cards felt too strong/weak?
- **Pacing**: Did the game feel too fast/slow?
- **Theme**: Did the satirical elements land?
