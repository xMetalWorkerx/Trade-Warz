## Game Setup

### 1. Initial Setup
- Each player chooses a leader and takes their starting GDP
- Separate cards into decks:
  - **Leader Decks**: Each player gets their leader's 8 cards
  - **Global Decks**: Shuffle remaining cards into 4 piles (Exports, Policies, Tactics, Events)
- Place 6 trading partner cards in the center
- Each player draws 5 cards (from any deck)
- Set up 3-minute timer

### 2. First Round
- **Event**: Draw and resolve top event card
- **Upkeep**: Resolve any ongoing effects (C→M→Y→K order)
- **Draw**: Each player draws up to their leader's hand size limit
- **Policy**: Each player may play 1 policy card face-down, reveal simultaneously
- **Trade**: 3-minute timer for export placement and disputes
- **Income**: Collect GDP from routes, policies, events
- **Cleanup**: Reset timer (no hand size management needed)

## Core Rules Clarification

**IMPORTANT: Trade routes and influence persist throughout the game - see mechanics_prototype.md for detailed rules**

### Trade Route Persistence
- **Once established, trade routes remain active for the entire game** unless explicitly removed by card effects
- Routes generate GDP and influence every round they remain active
- Only specific Tactic or Policy effects that say "destroy" or "remove" can eliminate routes

### Influence Accumulation
- **Influence accumulates throughout the game and never decreases naturally**
- Each active trade route generates influence with its Trade Partner every round
- Influence only decreases when explicitly removed by card effects
- Accumulated influence provides dispute advantages and suzerainty benefits

## Simplified Rules for Prototype

### Trade Phase
1. **Placement**: Players place export cards face-down on trading partner slots
2. **Timer**: 3-minute countdown starts when first export is placed
3. **Disputes**: Resolve contested slots in reverse-GDP order (poorest first)
4. **Resolution**: Printed Influence + blind GDP bid wins

### GDP Economy
- **Trade Routes**: 60-70% of income (Export Value + Trading Partner Bonus)
- **Policies**: 20-25% of income (ongoing effects)
- **Tactics**: 10-15% of income (instant effects)

### Win Conditions
- **Instant Win**: Reach 50 GDP immediately
- **Timed Win**: Highest GDP after 5 rounds
- **Tiebreaker**: Most trading partners influenced

## Prototype Testing Focus

### Key Questions to Answer
1. **Is the 3-minute timer fun or stressful?**
2. **Do the card effects create interesting decisions?**
3. **Is the GDP economy balanced?**
4. **Are the trading partner abilities too powerful?**
5. **Does the game feel too short/long?**

### Balance Issues to Watch
- **Pipeline Monopoly**: Is the destruction bonus too strong?
- **Currency Manipulation**: Does the GDP swap break close games?
- **Oil Shock**: What counts as "Energy-related" exports?
- **Meme War**: Is stealing random cards too random?

### Feedback to Collect
- **Fun factor**: Which cards created the most excitement?
- **Confusion**: Which rules were unclear?
- **Balance**: Which cards felt too strong/weak?
- **Pacing**: Did the game feel too fast/slow?
- **Theme**: Did the satirical elements land?

## Quick Reference

### Turn Order
1. **Event** → 2. **Upkeep** → 3. **Draw (to hand size)** → 4. **Policy** → 5. **Trade (3 min)** → 6. **Income** → 7. **Cleanup**

### Card Types
- **Blue (Exports)**: Trade routes, generate GDP + influence
- **Green (Policies)**: Ongoing effects, played during policy phase
- **Red (Tactics)**: Instant effects, played anytime before trade ends
- **Event**: Global effects, drawn at start of each round

### Dispute Resolution
1. Poorest player chooses one contested route
2. Both players bid GDP secretly
3. Highest (Printed Influence + GDP bid) wins
4. Winner pays bid, loser takes export back
5. Repeat until all disputes resolved
