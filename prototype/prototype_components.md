## Prototype Components (Physical)

Concise specs to make the timed Trade Phase fast, readable, and tactile. Focus: slide-under export slots along the edge of each Trading Partner using simple “slot strips.”

### Component Checklist
- Leader boards (3-6)
- Trading Partner cards (use 6 for prototype)
- Slot strips (tuck-under rails): 3-slot, 4-slot, 5-slot variants
- 99 prototype cards (leader + global + events)
- GDP tokens (coins work)
- Influence cubes
- 3-minute timer

### Slot Strips (Tuck-Under Rails)
Purpose: Make route slots obvious and quick to resolve by sliding the short edge of an Export card under a thin rail at the Trading Partner’s edge. This creates clear occupancy without covering card text.

Specs (for poker-size cards, 63 × 88 mm):
- Strip heights: 18–20 mm
- Tuck depth: 10–12 mm (leave card title/influence visible)
- Lengths by market size (including 4 mm end margins):
  - 3-slot: 70–76 mm
  - 4-slot: 94–100 mm
  - 5-slot: 118–124 mm
- Slot dividers: 1 mm printed tick marks with small numbers (1…N)
- Color coding: Small/Medium/Large market color strip to match docs

Construction options (choose any):
1) Paper fast-build (5 min per strip)
   - Print on 300 gsm cardstock. Score a 10–12 mm fold to form a shallow pocket lip. Tape underside ends to hold the lip. Place along the long edge of the partner card.
2) Sleeve hack (ultra-fast)
   - Put the partner card in a standard sleeve. Tape a 15–18 mm cardstock lip to the sleeve front, creating a pocket. Replace tape as it wears.
3) Deluxe rail (if you have access)
   - 3D print or laser-cut a low-profile rail with 10–12 mm capture depth and slot index notches.

Usage during play:
- When placing, slide the Export’s short edge under the partner’s strip at the chosen numbered slot.
- During disputes, keep both contested Exports tucked at the same slot until resolution; winner remains tucked, loser returns to hand.
- Established routes stay tucked for persistence until destroyed.

Readability rules:
- Do not cover the Export’s title bar or influence icons.
- Align all tucked cards flush to the strip to avoid drift.
- If strips shift, realign immediately before resolving disputes.

### Trading Partner Card Layout Guidance
- Place the strip along the card’s long edge nearest the table center for easier reach.
- Add a tiny arrow/icon on the partner card pointing to the strip side (“Routes tuck here →”).
- Use the partner’s market size color ring on the strip for quick recognition.

### Leader Boards (edge interactions)
- Keep GDP track and hand-size reference clear; no tuck needed here.
- Optional: a thin reminder band along the lower edge with CMYK order and “Timer starts on first Export.”

### Dispute Workflow with Strips (quick reference)
1. Timer ends → flip all newly placed Exports at each contested slot.
2. Resolve in reverse GDP order. Keep both cards tucked until winner determined.
3. Winner pays bid and leaves card tucked; loser returns card to hand.
4. Proceed until all disputes cleared.

### Print Notes
- Provide 3 PDFs: 3-slot, 4-slot, 5-slot strips with cut/fold guides.
- Print at 100% scale on 300 gsm; matte finish preferred.
- One strip per Trading Partner used that game.

### Playtest Questions (for strips)
- Was “which slots are full” instantly readable?
- Did the tuck depth feel secure without hiding info?
- Any disputes caused by physical ambiguity?
