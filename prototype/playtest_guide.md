- [ ] Influence tracking (colored cubes/tokens)
- [ ] 6 trading partner cards
- [ ] Leader boards (simple paper sheets)
- [ ] Notepad for feedback

### Player Preparation

## During the Playtest

### What to Watch For

#### Game Flow
- [ ] **Timer pressure**: Is the 3-minute trade phase fun or stressful?
- [ ] **Decision points**: Are there meaningful choices each turn?
- [ ] **Pacing**: Does the game feel too fast/slow?
- [ ] **Engagement**: Are players actively involved or waiting?

#### Card Balance
- [ ] **Power level**: Which cards feel too strong/weak?
- [ ] **Cost vs effect**: Are the GDP costs appropriate?
- [ ] **Strategic depth**: Do cards create interesting decisions?
- [ ] **Thematic fit**: Do effects match the satirical theme?

#### Player Interaction
- [ ] **Disputes**: Are they exciting or frustrating?
- [ ] **Targeting**: Is there too much/little player conflict?
- [ ] **Catch-up**: Can trailing players recover?
- [ ] **Runaway leaders**: Does anyone dominate too easily?

#### Rules Clarity
- [ ] **Confusion points**: Where do players get stuck?
- [ ] **Edge cases**: What situations need clarification?
- [ ] **Timing**: When do effects resolve?
- [ ] **Interactions**: How do cards work together?
- [ ] **Persistence rules**: Do players understand routes and influence are permanent?

## Post-Playtest Feedback

### Immediate Questions (Ask Right After Game)

#### Overall Experience
1. **Fun factor**: "On a scale of 1-10, how fun was that?"
2. **Replayability**: "Would you want to play again?"
3. **Theme**: "Did the satirical elements land?"
4. **Length**: "Did the game feel too short/long?"

#### Specific Mechanics
1. **Timer**: "How did the 3-minute trade phase feel?"
2. **Disputes**: "Were the blind bids exciting or annoying?"
3. **Card effects**: "Which cards created the most excitement?"
4. **Leader abilities**: "Did the different leaders feel distinct?"

#### Balance Issues
1. **Power cards**: "Which cards felt too strong/weak?"
2. **Leader balance**: "Did any leader feel overpowered?"
3. **Catch-up**: "Could trailing players recover?"
4. **Win conditions**: "Did the 50 GDP target feel right?"

### Detailed Feedback Form

#### Card-Specific Feedback
For each card, ask:
- **Power level**: Too strong, just right, or too weak?
- **Fun factor**: Did it create excitement or frustration?
- **Clarity**: Was the effect clear?
- **Thematic fit**: Did it match the satirical theme?

#### Leader-Specific Feedback
For each leader, ask:
- **Distinctiveness**: Did it feel different from other leaders?
- **Balance**: Was it competitive with other leaders?
- **Fun factor**: Was it enjoyable to play?

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Balance Problems
- **Pipeline Monopoly**: Is the destruction bonus too strong?
- **Currency Manipulation**: Does the GDP swap break close games?
- **State-Run Energy**: Is the +1 GDP per export too powerful?
- **Meme War**: Is stealing random cards too random?

### Rules Confusion
- **Oil Shock**: What counts as "Energy-related" exports?
- **Trade Bloc Party**: How do alliances work exactly?
- **Bureaucratic Gridlock**: When does the policy restriction apply?
- **Copycat Factories**: How does copying revenue work?
- **Route Persistence**: Do players understand routes stay on the board permanently?
- **Influence Accumulation**: Do players understand influence never decreases naturally?

### Player Experience Issues
- **Analysis paralysis**: Are players taking too long?
- **Downtime**: Are players waiting too much?
- **Frustration**: Are any mechanics annoying?
- **Confusion**: Are the rules too complex?

## Iteration Notes

### After Each Playtest
1. **Record feedback** immediately
2. **Identify patterns** in player responses
