# Trade Warz - Complete Prototype Directory

*Complete playable prototype for testing core mechanics and leader asymmetry*

## What's Here

This directory contains everything needed to test the 99-card prototype of Trade Warz:

### Core Files
- **`prototype_cards.md`** - Original 20 cards with stats and effects
- **`leader_decks.md`** - Complete leader-specific card sets (24 cards)
- **`global_decks.md`** - Complete global card pools (55 cards)
- **`prototype_setup.md`** - Quick-start guide and simplified rules
- **`leader_specs.md`** - Detailed leader specifications for testing
- **`playtest_guide.md`** - How to run effective playtests

### What You Need to Play
- **99 cards total** (24 leader + 55 global + 20 original)
- **GDP tokens** (pennies/nickels work fine)
- **3-minute timer** (phone timer or sand timer)
- **Influence tracking** (colored cubes or tokens)
- **6 trading partner cards** (use specs from `prototype_setup.md`)

## Quick Start

1. **Read `prototype_setup.md`** for game rules and setup
2. **Print all 99 cards** from the card files:
   - `prototype_cards.md` (20 original cards)
   - `leader_decks.md` (24 leader-specific cards)
   - `global_decks.md` (55 global cards)
3. **Choose 2-3 leaders** from `leader_specs.md`
4. **Set up trading partners** as described in setup guide
5. **Play a game** following the simplified rules
6. **Use `playtest_guide.md`** to collect feedback

## Testing Focus

This prototype is designed to test:
- **Core mechanics** (3-minute timer, disputes, GDP economy)
- **Card balance** (are the effects fun and fair?)
- **Leader asymmetry** (do different leaders feel distinct?)
- **Player interaction** (are disputes exciting?)
- **Theme execution** (does the satire land?)
- **Deck construction** (do leader vs global cards create interesting decisions?)
- **Strategic depth** (are there multiple viable strategies?)

## Success Criteria

The prototype succeeds if:
- **Players want to play again** (fun factor)
- **All leaders feel competitive** (balance)
- **Rules are clear** (clarity)
- **Satirical elements land** (theme)

## Next Steps

After playtesting:
- **If fun**: Expand to full 50+ card sets
- **If needs work**: Fix balance and clarity issues
- **If broken**: Rebuild core mechanics
