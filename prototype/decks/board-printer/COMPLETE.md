## 🎯 How to Print Your Prototype

### Step 1: Preview (Optional)
Open preview.html files in a browser to see how boards will look:
- `dist/leaders/preview.html`
- `dist/trading-partners/preview.html`

### Step 2: Print Boards
```bash
# Print these files on 80-110lb cardstock:
dist/leaders/fronts.pdf           (2 sheets)
dist/trading-partners/fronts.pdf  (8 sheets)
```

**Total**: 10 sheets

### Step 3: Cut Boards
- Cut along the outer bleed guides (dashed red lines)
- Each leader board should be 6" × 8" (portrait)
- Each trading partner board should be 8" × 6" (landscape)
- You'll have 2 empty slots total

### Step 4: Verify Dimensions
- Leader boards: 6" wide × 8" tall
- Trading partner boards: 8" wide × 6" tall
- Use a ruler to check first few cuts

### Step 5: Organize
Sort boards by type:
- **3 Leader Boards**: USA, China, Russia
- **15 Trading Partner Boards**: By market size (large/medium/small)

### Step 6: PLAYTEST! 🎲
You now have complete board game prototype components!

## 🎯 Printing Tips

1. **Test First**: Print one sheet to verify alignment
2. **Margins**: Already optimized for standard printers
3. **Cardstock**: Use 80-110lb for durability
4. **Guides**: Bleed guides show where to cut
5. **Paper**: US Letter (8.5" × 11") standard
6. **Settings**: Print at 100% scale, no "fit to page"
7. **Quality**: Use high/best quality setting

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Boards don't align after cutting
→ Verify printer printed at 100% scale (no "fit to page")

### Colors too dark/light when printed
→ Adjust hex values in `src/styles/*.css`

### Need different board dimensions
→ Change `BOARD_MM` in `src/config.ts`

### Text too small/large
→ Adjust font-size in CSS files
