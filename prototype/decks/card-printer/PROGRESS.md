## 🎯 Next Step: Phase 5 - Generator Script

Only one phase remains! This requires Playwright to be installed:

### Phase 5: Generator Script ⏳
Implement the main PDF generator:
1. ⏳ Load JSON data by deck type
2. ⏳ Select appropriate templates based on card type
3. ⏳ Compile cards with Handlebars
4. ⏳ Inject card data (colors, rarities, stats)
5. ⏳ Arrange cards in 6-up sheets
6. ⏳ Generate HTML preview files
7. ⏳ Render PDFs via Playwright
8. ⏳ Handle partial sheets (empty slots)
9. ⏳ Generate matching backs PDFs

## 🔧 Deferred Items

- **Playwright Chromium Installation**: Will install when network connection improves
  ```bash
  npm run install:pw
  ```

## 📈 Completion Status

- **Phase 1**: 95% ✅ (missing only Playwright browser)
- **Phase 2**: 100% ✅
- **Phase 3**: 100% ✅ (all templates complete!)
- **Phase 4**: 100% ✅ (all styling complete!)
- **Phase 5**: 0% ⏳ (waiting on Playwright)
- **Overall**: ~85% complete! 🎉

## 💡 What's Been Accomplished

We've completed all the preparation work:
1. ✅ Designed all card templates (HTML/Handlebars) - 7 templates
2. ✅ Created all card styling (CSS) - 7 style files
3. ✅ Converted 75 cards from markdown to JSON
4. ✅ Built comprehensive configuration system
5. ⏳ Ready for PDF generation (needs Playwright)

**Only the generator script remains!** Once Playwright is installed, we can test and generate PDFs.

## 🎨 Design Decisions Made

- **Card Size**: Poker-sized (2.5" × 3.5")
- **Layout**: 6-up (2 columns × 3 rows)
- **Paper**: US Letter (8.5" × 11")
- **Stock**: 80lb laser gloss cover
- **Printing**: Single-sided with letter backs
- **Back Codes**: E (Export), P (Policy), T (Tactic), V (Event), L (Leader)
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Export: Blue (#2563eb)
  - Policy: Green (#16a34a)
  - Tactic: Red (#dc2626)
  - Event: Purple (#9333ea)
  - Leader: Gold (#ca8a04)

## 🎯 Ready to Continue!

We have everything we need to continue with Phase 3 (templates) and Phase 4 (styling) without any network downloads. Should we proceed?
