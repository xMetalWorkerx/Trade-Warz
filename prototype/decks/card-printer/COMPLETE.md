## 🎯 How to Print Your Prototype

### Step 1: Preview (Optional)
Open any `preview.html` file in a browser to see how cards will look.

### Step 2: Print Fronts
```bash
# Print these files on 80lb cardstock:
dist/exports/fronts.pdf    (3 sheets)
dist/policies/fronts.pdf   (3 sheets)
dist/tactics/fronts.pdf    (3 sheets)
dist/events/fronts.pdf     (2 sheets)
dist/leaders/fronts.pdf    (4 sheets)
```

**Total fronts**: 15 sheets

### Step 3: Print Backs
```bash
# Print these files on same cardstock:
dist/exports/backs.pdf     (3 sheets) - Letter "E"
dist/policies/backs.pdf    (3 sheets) - Letter "P"
dist/tactics/backs.pdf     (3 sheets) - Letter "T"
dist/events/backs.pdf      (2 sheets) - Letter "V"
dist/leaders/backs.pdf     (4 sheets) - Letter "L"
```

**Total backs**: 15 sheets

### Step 4: Cut Cards
- Cut along the visible guides
- Each card should be 2.5" × 3.5" (standard poker size)
- You'll have some empty slots (15 total across all sheets)

### Step 5: Organize
Sort cards by letter code on back:
- **E** (Blue) = Exports (14 cards)
- **P** (Green) = Policies (14 cards)
- **T** (Red) = Tactics (15 cards)
- **V** (Purple) = Events (11 cards)
- **L** (Gold) = Leaders (21 cards)

### Step 6: Optional - Sleeve
Use standard poker-sized card sleeves (2.5" × 3.5")

### Step 7: PLAYTEST! 🎲
You now have a complete Trade Warz prototype!
