---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Install Playwright (when network improves)
```bash
cd prototype/decks/card-printer
npm run install:pw
```
This downloads a 174MB Chromium browser for PDF rendering.

### Step 2: Test the converter (works now!)
```bash
npm run convert
```
This re-reads your markdown files and regenerates JSON. Already done, but you can run it again after editing cards.

### Step 3: Generate PDFs (after Step 1)
```bash
# Generate all cards
npm run build:all

# Or generate specific types
npm run build:exports    # Just global exports
npm run build:policies   # Just global policies
npm run build:leaders    # All leader decks
```

### Step 4: Print & Play!
1. Open `dist/exports/fronts.pdf` (and other types)
2. Print on 80lb laser gloss cover stock
3. Print matching backs PDFs
4. Cut along guides
5. Sleeve (optional)
6. **Playtest!**

## 📦 Output Structure

After running `npm run build:all`:
```
dist/
├── exports/
│   ├── fronts.pdf    (3 sheets, 14 cards)
│   ├── backs.pdf     (3 sheets with "E")
│   └── preview.html  (browser preview)
├── policies/
│   ├── fronts.pdf    (3 sheets, 14 cards)
│   ├── backs.pdf     (3 sheets with "P")
│   └── preview.html
├── tactics/
│   ├── fronts.pdf    (3 sheets, 15 cards)
│   ├── backs.pdf     (3 sheets with "T")
│   └── preview.html
├── events/
│   ├── fronts.pdf    (2 sheets, 11 cards)
│   ├── backs.pdf     (2 sheets with "V")
│   └── preview.html
└── leaders/
    ├── fronts.pdf    (4 sheets, 21 cards)
    ├── backs.pdf     (4 sheets with "L")
    └── preview.html
```

**Total**: 15 sheets × 2 (fronts + backs) = 30 pages to print

## 🎯 Printing Tips

1. **Test First**: Print one sheet to verify alignment
2. **Margins**: Adjust `SHEET.margin` in `config.ts` if needed
3. **Gutters**: Adjust `SHEET.gutter` for spacing between cards
4. **Guides**: Remove by adding `no-guides` class once calibrated
5. **Paper**: Use 80lb+ cardstock for durability
6. **Single-Sided**: Much easier than duplex printing
7. **Sleeves**: Standard poker-sized sleeves (2.5" × 3.5")

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Cards don't align after cutting
→ Adjust margins in `src/config.ts` → `SHEET.margin`

### Colors too dark/light when printed
→ Adjust hex values in `src/styles/*.css`

### Need more/fewer cards per sheet
→ Change `SHEET.cols` and `SHEET.rows` in `config.ts` (currently 2×3 = 6-up)

### Cards are wrong size
→ Verify `CARD_MM` in `config.ts` (currently 63.5mm × 88.9mm = 2.5" × 3.5")
