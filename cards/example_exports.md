- Effects match the thematic concept (e.g., OPEC = monopoly power)

### Balance Considerations
- **Cost vs Revenue**: Revenue is typically lower than cost, requiring multiple rounds to break even
- **Influence vs Revenue**: Higher influence exports often have lower revenue, creating trade-offs
- **Strategic Variety**: Different exports favor different strategies (wide vs tall, aggressive vs defensive)
- **Conditional Effects**: Bonus revenue requires meeting specific conditions, adding strategic depth
- **Investment Timing**: Higher cost exports require more upfront investment but may provide better long-term returns
