## Strategic Implications

- **China has 1/3 slots** - needs to destroy a route to get back in

### Available Opportunities
- **Japan**: 3 slots available (large market, good for expansion)
- **Turkey**: 3 slots available (medium market, balanced)
- **Argentina**: 3 slots available (small market, easy to control)
- **India**: 3 slots available (large market, high competition)

### Influence Accumulation
- **USA**: +1 influence with Singapore (now 2 total)
- **China**: +2 influence with Japan (now 2 total)
- **Russia**: +2 influence with Japan (now 2 total)

## Round 3 Developments

### Tactic Card Played
**China** plays "Cyber Attack" - destroys USA's "Tech Transfer" route to Singapore

### New Singapore Status
**Singapore** (3 slots):
- Slot 1: EMPTY (destroyed)
- Slot 2: China - "Port Access" (4 GDP, 1 influence)
- Slot 3: USA - "Hollywood Exports" (8 GDP, 3 influence)

### Strategic Consequences
- **Singapore slot freed up** - now available for new routes
- **USA loses 1 influence** with Singapore (back to 1 total)
- **China gains opportunity** to establish another route
- **Route destruction creates tactical value** beyond just hurting opponent

## Key Lessons

### Slot Scarcity Creates Competition
- **Limited slots force meaningful choices**
- **Players fight over valuable positions**
- **Not all routes are equally accessible**

### Influence Banking Value
- **USA's influence with Singapore persists** even after route destruction
- **Re-establishing route gives immediate benefits** from existing influence
- **Long-term influence investment pays off**

### Destruction Tactics
- **Destroying routes frees valuable slots**
- **Strategic destruction** can create opportunities for yourself
- **Route destruction has multiple benefits** (hurt opponent + free slot)

### Market Selection Strategy
- **Small markets fill up quickly** but are easier to control
- **Large markets offer more opportunities** but higher competition
- **Medium markets provide balanced risk/reward**
