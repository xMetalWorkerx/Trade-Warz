# Influence Accumulation Mechanic

## Overview

This document explores the concept of influence accumulating with trading partners at the end of each round, similar to how GDP is accumulated. This would create a secondary resource system that affects dispute resolution and potentially other game mechanics.

## Core Concept

**Influence Accumulation**: At the end of each round, players gain influence tokens equal to the total influence from their active trade routes. This influence accumulates with specific trading partners and can be used in future disputes or other game effects.

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Player Money Tokens from Bank
**Mechanism**: Use existing GDP tokens to track influence
- **Pros**: No additional components needed, simple to implement
- **Cons**: Could be confusing (GDP vs influence tokens), limited by available tokens
- **Implementation**: Players take GDP tokens from bank equal to their route influence, place them on trading partner cards

### Option 2: Separate Influence Tokens
**Mechanism**: Dedicated influence tokens for each player
- **Pros**: Clear distinction from GDP, unlimited supply, thematic clarity
- **Cons**: Additional component cost, more complex setup
- **Implementation**: Each player has colored influence tokens, place them on trading partner cards

### Option 3: Influence Track on Trading Partner Cards
**Mechanism**: Track influence with cubes or markers on trading partner cards
- **Pros**: Visual clarity, no token management, easy to read
- **Cons**: Requires trading partner cards with influence tracks, limited range
- **Implementation**: Each trading partner card has influence tracks, move cubes to track accumulated influence

## Influence Accumulation Rules

### Basic Accumulation
1. **End of Round**: After Income phase, each player calculates total influence from active routes
2. **Placement**: Place influence tokens on trading partner cards where routes are established
3. **Accumulation**: Influence tokens remain on trading partner cards until used or removed

### Influence Usage
- **Dispute Resolution**: Spend influence tokens to add to dispute resolution (1 influence = 1 dispute bonus)
- **Special Effects**: Some cards may require spending influence tokens
- **Trading Partner Control**: High influence may grant special abilities or bonuses

## Strategic Implications

### Influence as Secondary Resource
- **Investment vs Immediate Use**: Players must decide between building influence or spending it
- **Trading Partner Control**: Accumulating influence with specific partners creates territorial control
- **Dispute Advantage**: Stored influence provides insurance for future disputes

### Strategic Depth
- **Influence Hoarding**: Players might accumulate influence for big dispute wins
- **Influence Spending**: Players might spend influence immediately for tactical advantages
- **Territorial Control**: High influence with trading partners creates defensive advantages

---

## Balance Considerations

### Influence Economy
- **Accumulation Rate**: How much influence per round? (1-3 per route seems reasonable)
- **Spending Costs**: How much influence for different effects? (1-5 influence for various effects)
- **Maximum Storage**: Is there a cap on stored influence? (Probably not, but could be)

### Interaction with Existing Mechanics
- **Dispute Resolution**: Influence adds to existing "Influence + blind bid" system
- **Route Destruction**: What happens to stored influence when routes are destroyed?
- **Policy Effects**: Some policies might affect influence accumulation or spending

---

## Example Implementation

### Influence Accumulation Phase
1. **Calculate**: Each player totals influence from active routes
2. **Place**: Place influence tokens on trading partner cards
3. **Record**: Update influence totals (if using tracks)

### Influence Spending
- **Dispute Bonus**: Spend 1-3 influence for +1-3 to dispute resolution
- **Route Protection**: Spend 2 influence to prevent route destruction
- **Special Actions**: Spend 3-5 influence for unique effects

### Trading Partner Control
- **Suzerainty**: Player with most influence gets special bonuses
- **Defensive Bonus**: High influence provides protection against certain effects
- **Economic Bonus**: Influence might provide small GDP bonuses

## Design Questions

### 1. Component Choice
- **Money Tokens**: Simple but potentially confusing
- **Influence Tokens**: Clear but additional cost
- **Influence Tracks**: Visual but requires card redesign

### 2. Influence Economy
- **Accumulation Rate**: How much influence per route per round?
- **Spending Costs**: What do different effects cost?
- **Storage Limits**: Is there a maximum stored influence?

### 3. Game Balance
- **Dispute Impact**: How much should influence affect disputes?
- **Strategic Depth**: Does this add meaningful decisions?
- **Complexity**: Is this worth the added complexity?

## Recommendation

**Option 2: Separate Influence Tokens** seems most promising because:

1. **Clarity**: Clear distinction from GDP tokens
2. **Flexibility**: Unlimited supply allows for any influence amounts
3. **Thematic Fit**: Influence as a separate resource makes thematic sense
4. **Strategic Depth**: Creates interesting resource management decisions

### Proposed Implementation
- **Influence Tokens**: Each player has 20-30 colored influence tokens
- **Accumulation**: 1 influence per route per round (from route's influence value)
- **Storage**: Place tokens on trading partner cards
- **Usage**: Spend tokens for dispute bonuses, special effects, or trading partner control

### Balance Framework
- **Accumulation**: 1-3 influence per route per round
- **Dispute Bonus**: 1 influence = +1 to dispute resolution
- **Special Effects**: 2-5 influence for various effects
- **Trading Partner Control**: Player with most influence gets bonuses
