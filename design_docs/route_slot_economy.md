# Route Slot Economy

## Overview

Trading partners have limited route slots, creating natural scarcity and competition. This system replaces the previous GDP base bonuses with a slot-based economy that forces meaningful strategic choices about route placement.

## Slot Distribution

### Market Size Categories
- **Large Markets**: 5 slots (India, Japan, Brazil)
- **Medium Markets**: 4 slots (Mexico, Turkey, Korea, Australia, Canada, Indonesia)
- **Small Markets**: 3 slots (Singapore, Argentina, Switzerland, Vietnam, UAE, Nigeria)

### Why These Numbers?
- **Large Markets**: Can handle multiple simultaneous trade relationships
- **Medium Markets**: Significant capacity but geographically/thematically focused
- **Small Markets**: Limited physical capacity but high efficiency

---

## Game Math (4 Players)

### Prototype Configuration
- **6 Trading Partners** × 4 average slots = **24 total route slots**
- **4 Players** × 6 target routes = **24 desired routes**
- Creates perfect tension without total lockout

### Different Player Counts
- **3 Players**: Use 5 partners (19 slots) - good for 3 × 6-7 routes
- **5-6 Players**: Use 8-9 partners (33-36 slots) - accommodates larger groups

## Strategic Implications

### Slot Scarcity
- **Forces meaningful choices** about route placement
- **Creates competition** for prime slots
- **Prevents unlimited expansion** - players must prioritize

### Influence Banking
- **Establish routes for influence** even if they might be destroyed
- **Influence persists** after route destruction
- **Long-term investment** strategy becomes viable

### Destruction Value
- **Destroying routes frees valuable slots**
- **Route destruction has strategic value** beyond just hurting opponents
- **Creates interesting risk/reward decisions**

### Market Selection
- **Large Markets**: More opportunity but harder to dominate
- **Medium Markets**: Balanced risk/reward
- **Small Markets**: Easier to control but limited slots

---

## Competition Dynamics

### Early Game Strategy
- **Rush for small markets** (easy influence thresholds)
- **Establish multiple low-influence routes** for territory
- **Focus on slot occupation** over optimization

### Mid Game Strategy
- **Fight for medium markets** (good bonuses, balanced competition)
- **Optimize existing routes** with influence bonuses
- **Target opponent routes** to free up slots

### Late Game Strategy
- **Invest heavily in large markets** (powerful bonuses)
- **Use route destruction** to control key slots
- **Maximize influence** for suzerainty benefits

## Economic Impact

### GDP Sources (No Base Bonuses)
All GDP now comes from:
1. **Export card values** (increased by 1-2 GDP to compensate)
2. **Influence bonuses** (unique per trading partner)
3. **Suzerainty abilities** (special powers for most influence)
4. **Policy and Tactic effects** (strategic modifiers)

### Route Value Calculation
**Total Route Value** = Export Base Value + Influence Bonuses + Suzerainty Benefits

**Example**: Freedom Corn (4 GDP) + Singapore Free Port bonus (+1 GDP) + Suzerainty ability = 5+ GDP per round

## Slot Modifications

### Policies That Affect Slots
- **"Trade Expansion"**: Target partner gains +1 route slot this round
- **"Infrastructure Investment"**: All partners gain +1 slot permanently
- **"Economic Sanctions"**: Remove 1 slot from target partner

### Events That Affect Slots
- **"Trade War Escalates"**: Remove 1 unoccupied slot from each Large Market
- **"Infrastructure Collapse"**: Remove 1 slot from random partner
- **"Economic Boom"**: Add 1 slot to each Small Market

### Special Cards
- **"Hostile Takeover"**: Can be played on occupied slot, destroys existing route
- **"Corporate Merger"**: Combine two routes into one slot (rare)
- **"Trade Diversification"**: Establish route without using a slot (one-time use)

---

## Design Benefits

### Natural Balance
- **Slot scarcity prevents runaway leaders**
- **Influence banking rewards long-term thinking**
- **Destruction creates comeback opportunities**

### Strategic Depth
- **Multiple viable strategies** (wide vs tall, aggressive vs defensive)
- **Interesting timing decisions** (when to establish vs when to destroy)
- **Territorial control** becomes meaningful

### Player Engagement
- **Every slot matters** - no throwaway routes
- **Competition creates tension** throughout the game
- **Comeback mechanics** keep trailing players engaged

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Balance Metrics
- **Slot utilization**: Are 80-90% of slots filled by game end?
- **Competition level**: Do players fight over slots regularly?
- **Destruction frequency**: Are routes destroyed 1-2 times per game?
- **Influence accumulation**: Do players reach high influence levels?

### Player Experience
- **Decision paralysis**: Do slot limitations create interesting choices?
- **Frustration levels**: Are players blocked too often or too rarely?
- **Strategic variety**: Do different approaches feel viable?
- **Game length**: Does slot scarcity extend or compress game time?

---

## Implementation Notes

### Visual Design
- **Clear slot indicators** on trading partner cards
- **Easy to see** which slots are occupied
- **Simple tracking** of available vs filled slots
- **Optional slot strips**: physical 3/4/5-slot tuck-under rails that make slot occupancy and disputes unambiguous

### Rule Clarity
- **Slot availability checked before placement**
- **No targeting occupied slots** (except special cards)
- **Clear consequences** of route destruction

### Component Requirements
- **Route markers** to show slot occupation
- **Visual distinction** between market sizes
- **Easy setup** and teardown

---

## Future Considerations

### Expansion Possibilities
- **New trading partners** with different slot counts
- **Variable slot systems** (slots change based on events)
- **Advanced slot mechanics** (shared slots, temporary slots)

### Advanced Variants
- **Dynamic slots**: Slot count changes based on influence
- **Specialized slots**: Different slot types for different exports
- **Regional slots**: Slots shared between related partners
