# Route Persistence Mechanics

## Overview

Trade routes in Trade Warz are **permanent** once established. This creates a persistent economic engine that escalates throughout the game, rewarding early investment and creating strategic depth. Understanding route persistence is crucial for both players and designers.

## Core Rules

### 1. **Routes Are Permanent**
- Once successfully placed on a Trading Partner slot, a route remains active for the **entire game**
- Routes never "expire," "end," or "reset" naturally
- Routes continue generating GDP and influence every round they remain active

### 2. **Route Removal**
Routes can only be removed by **explicit card effects** that use specific language:
- **"Destroy target trade route"**
- **"Remove all routes to [Trading Partner]"**
- **"Destroy an opponent's route"**

### 3. **Route Protection**
Some cards provide temporary protection:
- **"Your routes cannot be destroyed this round"**
- **"Routes are immune to destruction"**

## Economic Impact

### Income Generation
Each active route generates income every round based on:
- **Export Value** (printed on the card)
- **Trading Partner Bonus** (+1 Small, +2 Medium, +3 Large markets)
- **Route Multipliers** (first route bonus, leader abilities, etc.)

### Example: Early Investment Payoff
**Round 1**: Player places "Freedom Corn" (3 GDP cost, 2 revenue, 2 influence)
- **Round 1**: Pays 3 GDP, gains 2 GDP income
- **Round 2**: Gains 2 GDP income (net +1 GDP)
- **Round 3**: Gains 2 GDP income (net +3 GDP)
- **Round 4**: Gains 2 GDP income (net +5 GDP)
- **Round 5**: Gains 2 GDP income (net +7 GDP)

**Total Return**: 7 GDP profit over 5 rounds from a 3 GDP investment

## Strategic Implications

### 1. **Early Game Focus**
- Establishing routes early creates compounding returns
- Players should prioritize route establishment over short-term GDP gains
- The 3-minute timer creates pressure to make quick route decisions

### 2. **Route Investment Strategy**
- **High-value routes** (5+ revenue) provide better long-term returns
- **Influence-heavy routes** (3+ influence) create territorial control
- **Balanced routes** (moderate revenue + influence) offer flexibility

### 3. **Route Destruction**
- **Expensive but impactful**: Route destruction cards cost 4-6 GDP
- **Permanent consequences**: Destroyed routes are gone forever
- **Strategic timing**: Destroy routes when opponents are vulnerable

### 4. **Route Protection**
- **Defensive cards** can protect valuable routes
- **Timing matters**: Protection effects last only one round
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Is protection worth the card cost?

## Influence Accumulation

### How Influence Works
- Each active route generates influence with its Trading Partner every round
- Influence accumulates and **never decreases naturally**
- Higher influence provides dispute advantages and suzerainty benefits

### Example: Influence Growth
**Round 1**: Player places "Factory of Everything" on Japan (2 influence)
- **Round 1**: +2 influence with Japan
- **Round 2**: +2 influence with Japan (total: 4)
- **Round 3**: +2 influence with Japan (total: 6)
- **Round 4**: +2 influence with Japan (total: 8)
- **Round 5**: +2 influence with Japan (total: 10)

**Result**: Player has 10 influence with Japan, providing maximum benefits

## Design Considerations

### 1. **Balance Testing**
- **Route destruction** must be expensive enough to prevent abuse
- **Route protection** must be temporary to maintain strategic tension
- **Route establishment** must be rewarding but not overpowered

### 2. **Player Experience**
- **Clear communication**: Players must understand routes are permanent
- **Visual tracking**: Routes should be clearly marked on the board
- **Strategic depth**: Permanence creates meaningful long-term decisions

### 3. **Game Flow**
- **Early game**: Focus on route establishment
- **Mid game**: Route optimization and protection
- **Late game**: Route destruction and final pushes

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. **Player Mistakes**
- **Removing routes at round end**: Routes stay on the board
- **Forgetting route income**: Each route generates income every round
- **Underestimating route value**: Early routes compound over time

### 2. **Design Mistakes**
- **Making routes temporary**: Breaks the economic engine
- **Overpowered destruction**: Makes route investment pointless
- **Underpowered protection**: Makes routes too vulnerable

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Route Establishment
**Player A** places "Pipeline Empire" on Germany in Round 1:
- **Cost**: 6 GDP
- **Revenue**: 6 GDP per round
- **Influence**: 2 per round
- **Break-even**: Round 2
- **Total profit by Round 5**: 24 GDP

### Example 2: Route Destruction
**Player B** plays "Gas Leak" tactic in Round 3:
- **Cost**: 5 GDP
- **Effect**: Destroy Player A's Pipeline Empire
- **Result**: Player A loses 18 GDP in future income
- **Net effect**: Player B gains 13 GDP advantage

### Example 3: Route Protection
**Player A** plays "Belt and Road Protection" in Round 2:
- **Cost**: 1 GDP
- **Effect**: Routes cannot be destroyed this round
- **Result**: Pipeline Empire survives destruction attempt
- **Net effect**: Player A saves 18 GDP in future income

## Testing Guidelines

### 1. **Route Value Testing**
- Track total GDP generated by each route over 5 rounds
- Compare route costs to total returns
- Identify overpowered or underpowered routes

### 2. **Destruction Balance Testing**
- Test route destruction cards against various route values
- Ensure destruction is expensive but not prohibitive
- Verify destruction creates meaningful strategic decisions

### 3. **Protection Testing**
- Test route protection cards against destruction attempts
- Ensure protection is temporary and costly
- Verify protection creates interesting timing decisions

## Conclusion

Route persistence is a core mechanic that creates the persistent economic engine driving Trade Warz. Understanding how routes work, how they generate income, and how they can be protected or destroyed is essential for both players and designers. The permanence of routes creates strategic depth, rewards early investment, and provides meaningful long-term decision-making throughout the game.
