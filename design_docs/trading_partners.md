## Route Slot Economy

### Game Math (4-Player Example)
- **6 Trading Partners** × average 4 slots = **24 total route slots**
- Each player targets **5-7 active routes** (20-28 total demand)
- Creates **natural competition** for prime slots
- Players will attempt **~10 Export placements** per game (accounting for destruction/replacement)

### Strategic Implications
- **Slot Scarcity**: Forces meaningful choices about route placement
- **Influence Banking**: Establish routes for influence even if temporary
- **Destruction Value**: Destroying routes frees valuable slots
- **Market Selection**: Large = more opportunity, Small = easier control

### Competition Dynamics
- **Early Game**: Rush for small markets (easy influence)
- **Mid Game**: Fight for medium markets (good bonuses)
- **Late Game**: Invest heavily in large markets (powerful bonuses)
