# Trading Partners

## Overview

Trading partners function as "city-states" in Trade Warz, inspired by Civilization's influence system. Players compete for influence with these nations to gain scaling economic benefits and suzerainty bonuses.

## Core Mechanics

- **Influence Tracks**: Each trading partner has influence tracks for all players (0-10 range)
- **Scaling Benefits**: Higher influence provides better economic returns
- **Suzerainty**: Player with most influence gets special bonuses
- **Market Size**: Determines base GDP bonus (+1 Small, +2 Medium, +3 Large)
