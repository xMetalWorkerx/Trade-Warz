# GDP Economy Framework

## Overview

The GDP economy is the heart of Trade Warz, designed to create interesting strategic decisions while maintaining balance and catch-up mechanics. Trade routes provide the primary economic engine (60-70% of income), with policies and tactics offering strategic modifiers and tactical swings.

## Core Principle

**Trade Routes as Economic Engine**: Most GDP comes from established trade routes, with policies and tactics providing strategic depth and tactical opportunities.

## GDP Income Sources

### 1. Trade Routes (Primary - 60-70% of GDP)

**Base Formula**: `Export Value + Trading Partner Bonus + Route Multipliers`

#### Export Cards (Blue-backed)
- **Common Exports**: 2-4 GDP cost, 2-4 GDP revenue per round
- **Uncommon Exports**: 3-5 GDP cost, 3-5 GDP revenue per round
- **Rare Exports**: 4-7 GDP cost, 4-7 GDP revenue per round

#### Trading Partner Bonuses
- **Small Markets**: +1 GDP (emerging economies)
- **Medium Markets**: +2 GDP (developed economies)
- **Large Markets**: +3 GDP (major economic powers)

#### Route Multipliers
- **First Route to Partner**: +1 GDP (pioneer bonus)
- **Monopoly Routes**: +2 GDP (only player trading with that partner)
- **Route Chains**: +1 GDP per connected route (if you have 3+ routes to same partner)

#### Example Trade Route
- Rare Export (5 GDP cost, 5 GDP revenue) + Large Market (+3 GDP) + First Route (+1 GDP) = **9 GDP per round**

### 2. Policy Cards (Secondary - 20-25% of GDP)

#### Economic Policies (Green-backed)
- **Direct Income**: +2-4 GDP per round
- **Multipliers**: +1 GDP per active trade route
- **Bonuses**: +3 GDP when you win disputes
- **Catch-up**: +1 GDP per round you're behind the leader

#### Trade Policies
- **Influence Bonuses**: +1-2 Influence in disputes (indirect GDP)
- **Export Slots**: +1 additional export slot
- **Dispute Advantages**: Win ties, or +1 GDP when you lose disputes

### 3. Tactic Cards (Tactical - 10-15% of GDP)

#### Instant Effects (Red-backed)
- **Direct GDP**: +3-6 GDP immediately
- **Sabotage**: -2-4 GDP to opponents
- **Route Destruction**: Destroy opponent's trade route
- **Policy Theft**: Steal opponent's policy card

## GDP Costs & Spending

### Trade Route Establishment
- **Export Cost**: 2-7 GDP (varies by export rarity)
- **Dispute Bidding**: 1-5 GDP (blind bid for contested routes)
- **Route Maintenance**: 0 GDP (routes persist until destroyed)

### Policy Costs
- **Economic Policies**: 2-4 GDP to play
- **Trade Policies**: 1-3 GDP to play
- **Disruptive Policies**: 3-5 GDP to play

### Tactic Costs
- **Instant GDP**: 1-2 GDP to play
- **Sabotage**: 2-4 GDP to play
- **Route Destruction**: 4-6 GDP to play

---

## Balance Framework

### Target GDP Progression (4-player game)
- **Round 1**: 3-6 GDP per player
- **Round 2**: 6-12 GDP per player  
- **Round 3**: 12-20 GDP per player
- **Round 4**: 20-35 GDP per player
- **Round 5**: 35-50+ GDP per player

### Income Distribution (per round)
- **Trade Routes**: 4-8 GDP (60-70%)
- **Policies**: 1-3 GDP (20-25%)
- **Tactics**: 0-2 GDP (10-15%)

### Catch-up Mechanics
- **Reverse-GDP Dispute Resolution**: Poorest player chooses first
- **Catch-up Policies**: +1 GDP per round you're behind
- **Route Destruction**: Tactics can break opponent's routes
- **Policy Theft**: Steal opponent's economic advantages

---

## Strategic Interactions

### Trade Route Strategies
1. **Wide Strategy**: Many small routes (4-5 routes × 3-4 GDP each)
2. **Tall Strategy**: Few large routes (2-3 routes × 6-8 GDP each)
3. **Monopoly Strategy**: Control specific trading partners
4. **Chain Strategy**: Connect multiple routes to same partners

### Policy Synergies
- **Economic + Trade**: Income multipliers + dispute advantages
- **Disruptive + Defensive**: Attack opponents while protecting yourself
- **Catch-up + Aggressive**: Come from behind with big swings

### Tactic Timing
- **Early Game**: Focus on route establishment
- **Mid Game**: Use policies for economic engines
- **Late Game**: Tactics for final pushes or disruption

## Mathematical Examples

### Example 1: Conservative Player (Round 3)
- 3 Trade Routes: (3+2+1) + (4+3+0) + (2+1+1) = **16 GDP revenue**
- 1 Economic Policy: +2 GDP per round = **2 GDP**
- **Total**: 18 GDP per round

### Example 2: Aggressive Player (Round 3)
- 2 Trade Routes: (5+3+2) + (4+2+1) = **17 GDP revenue**
- 1 Trade Policy: +1 GDP per route = **2 GDP**
- 1 Tactic: +4 GDP immediately = **4 GDP**
- **Total**: 23 GDP this round

### Example 3: Disruptive Player (Round 3)
- 2 Trade Routes: (3+2+0) + (2+1+0) = **8 GDP revenue**
- 1 Disruptive Policy: -3 GDP to leader = **-3 GDP to opponent**
- 1 Tactic: Destroy opponent's route = **-6 GDP to opponent**
- **Net Effect**: 8 GDP for me, -9 GDP for opponent

## Testing Framework

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **GDP sources** by category in each playtest
2. **Win rates** by strategy type and leader
3. **Game length** (target: 45-60 minutes)
4. **Player satisfaction** with economic decisions

### Balance Testing Approach
- **Blind leader selection** during testing
- **Track win rates** by leader and player count
- **Test edge cases** (all routes destroyed, policy theft, etc.)
- **Iterate on numbers** based on actual gameplay data

### Card Design Guidelines
- **Common Cards**: 2-4 GDP effects, simple mechanics
- **Uncommon Cards**: 3-6 GDP effects, moderate complexity
- **Rare Cards**: 4-8 GDP effects, complex interactions

## Implementation Notes

### Next Steps
1. **Create 20-30 placeholder cards** using this framework
2. **Build a paper prototype** with these GDP values
3. **Test the economic engine** with 2-3 players
4. **Iterate on numbers** based on actual gameplay
5. **Expand to full card sets** once the economy feels right

### Design Principles
- **Start simple** and iterate based on gameplay data
- **Maintain thematic consistency** with satirical economic theme
- **Ensure meaningful choices** at every decision point
- **Balance risk vs reward** in all mechanics
- **Preserve catch-up mechanics** to prevent runaway leaders
